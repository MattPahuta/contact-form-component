## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accessible design
- Flexbox

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Frontend build tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Form Styling Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuDpLN2dazU&t=43s) - Another great resource from Kevin Powell on using modern CSS to style a form. I used TailwindCSS for my styling, but this video was still hugely instructive on approaching a styling strategy.
- []() - Yet another Kevin Powell video tutorial where he is actually coding this exact challenge. I found this after I'd started the project and decided I was going to use Tailwind for my styling, so I definitely diverge in some areas. 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Tailwindcss docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#has)The official Tailwind docs have a use case example for the `:has()` selector that is pretty much perfect for styling the radio inputs for this project.
